# Using The Dojo
You can interact with challenges in three ways:

* [**Dojo Workspace**](https://pwn.college/workspace/code): a version of Visual Studio Code running inside the dojo.
* [**Dojo Desktop**](https://pwn.college/workspace/desktop) a full Linux GUI desktop running inside the dojo.
* **SSH Client**: you can set up your ssh client and ssh in.
