# Injection

## Command Injection
* Imagine an application that needs to run the 'date' system command
* The code for this system command resides in ```/user/bin/date```
* **system()**: an operation that exists in many languages that is used to execute a program
* **execve()**: a system call that launches a process
---
### Example
```system('date')```<br>
```execve("/bin/sh", ["sh", "-c", "date"], {...})```<br>
```execve("/usr/bin/date", ["date"], {...})```<br>

---
* Here, we are calling ```system()``` on the ```date``` program
* The first execve() command launches a shell, parses the program, and executes it in the shell
  * **Shell**: job is to parse your statement and convert it into program invocations
  * **-c**: flag that specifies the shell to parse the argument and run it, as if the user typed it into the terminal and ran it himself
* The second execve() command attempts to find the location of the ```date``` program within the shell
