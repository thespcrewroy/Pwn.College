# Injection

## Shell Command

- Imagine an application that needs to run the 'date' system command
- The code for this system command resides in `/user/bin/date`
- **system()**: an operation that exists in many languages that is used to execute a program
- **execve()**: a system call that launches a process

---

### Example

`system('date')`<br>
`execve("/bin/sh", ["sh", "-c", "date"], {...})`<br>
`execve("/usr/bin/date", ["date"], {...})`<br>

---

- Here, we are calling `system()` on the `date` program
- The first execve() command launches a shell, parses the argument (`date`), and executes it in the shell
  - **Shell**: job is to parse your statement and convert it into program invocations
  - **-c**: flag that specifies the shell to parse the argument and run it, as if the user typed it into the terminal and ran it himself
- The second execve() command attempts to find the location of the `date` program within the shell

## Environment Variables

- We can specify the timezone for the date
- We put environment variables before the program we want to run in order to do this

---

### Example: UTC

`system("TZ=UTC date")`<br>
`execve("/bin/sh", ["sh", "-c", "TZ=UTC date"], {...})`<br>
`execve("/usr/bin/date", ["date"], {"TZ": "UTC"})`<br>

</p>

### Example: MST

`system("TZ=MST date")`<br>
`execve("/bin/sh", ["sh", "-c", "TZ=MST date"], {...})`<br>
`execve("/usr/bin/date", ["date"], {"TZ": "MST"})`<br>

---

- Useful if we want different users from different timezones accessing the program
- We can also take a user response and inject that user-specified timezone into the website

## Command Injection: Part 1

- Issue: all we are doing is concatenating `TZ=<userInput>+date` and just pushing it off to the shell to execute
- **Backtick Operator (`` ` ``)**: if you specify another system program as an environment variable in between two backticks, the shell executes that program and uses the output of that command as the new timezone

  ***

### Example

`` system("TZ=`whoami` date") `` <br>
`` execve("/bin/sh", ["sh", "-c", "TZ=`whoami` date"], {...}) `` <br>
`execve("/usr/bin/whoami", ["whoami"], {...})` <br>
`execve("/usr/bin/date", ["date"], {"TZ": "root"})`

</p>

---

- The shell tries to run the `/user/bin/whoami` program to subsitute the output of the `whoami` command in for the `TZ` env variable
- Once the shell receives the output of `whoami` (in our case, it is _root_), it is passed into the `TZ` environment variable
- Now `/user/bin/date` is ran with the timezone of `root`

## Command Injection: Part 2

- We now understand that we have a very aggressive level of control over the launching shell if we have user input
- We can start our user input with a semicolon (`;`)

---

### Example

`system("TZ=; whoami # date")`<br>
`execve("/bin/sh", ["sh", "-c", "TZ=; whoami # date"], {...})`<br>
`execve("/usr/bin/whoami", ["whoami"], {...})`<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/thespcrewroy/Pwn.College/blob/main/05.%20IntroToCybersecurity/01.%20WebSecurity/assets/command-injection3.png" alt="Demo" width="500" />
</p>

---

- The semicolon specifies that we are passing in the empty string into the `TZ` environment variable
- After we end that shell statement, we move onto the next line in the shell to begin a new shell statement
- In this newline, we run the `whoami` command
- At the end of the statement, there is a space and a pound (`#`) symbol that follows
  - This pound (`#`) symbol comments out (ignores) the rest of the command, which in our case is `date`
  - Thus, instead of executing `whoami date`, we execute `whoami`
- It doesn't have to be `whoami`; now any program can be run if placed between the semicolon and pound symbols

## HTML Injection

- **html_response()**: we can supply any daya we want as it is up to the server to move and execute this arbitrary data
- You are not in a _text_ context, you are in an _HTML_ context

---

### Example

`html_response("<p>Hello, Connor!</p>")`<br>
`html_response("<p>Hello, <script>alert(1)</script>!</p>")`

</p>

- **`<script>`**: tag that allows you to manipulate the frontend by running arbitrary javascript within the HTML context
- Rather than running this locally and not doing much, a malicious actor can inject javascript into a field that gets inputted into a database and sent to a server, and not the malicious actor can run javascript on someone else's system
- Sanitization Technique:
  - Force your username only has alphanumeric characters
  - Encode characters into HTML character entities to remove them from an pure HTML context. Ex. writing `>` as `&gt;`. This will display a `>` symbol without treating the symbol as an HTML tag of a `>` symbol

## SQL Injection

### Example

</p>

---

- Usually the `admin` has the highest privelages so it is best to specify the _username_ as `admin`
- **`password = '' OR 1=1 --'"`**:
  - The `--` is a comment operator that specifies everything after it should be ignored
  - Specifies that the password is either the empty string or a TRUE statement (here, we chose `1=1`)
  - The above specification means that whatever we put into the password field will evaluate to TRUE
  - As a result, we select from USERS ONLY where the username is `admin`!
- Sanitization Techniques
  - Replace username and password with question marks
  - SQL parses out the query, and binds the data in after-the-fact
  - Parsing before data filling is always safer than the other way around, which is what SQL and most other languages support

## Stack

- Is not normally within a web security context, however, is still susceptible to injection based attacks
- Can be in a web security context IF you are writing your webserver in `C`

- The function `foo(char * input, size_t length)` takes in some `input` and some `length` as arguments
- The function is allocating 16 bytes of memory
- We are going to copy into the buffer some specified `input` with some specified `length`
- When we invoke the function, we are going to pass `input="bar"` and `length=3`
- When we call the function with an x86 chip architecture, we also push the return address `0x555555555042` to the stack
- `bar` end up on the stack after execution, and then we return to the next statement after the function `foo`

---

</p>

---

- We resume execution (return) after the function call by popping the contents and the return address from the stack
- Now we put 16 A's onto the stack by passing `input="AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"` and `length=16`

- Our buffer is defined to be 16 bytes that we allocate as per the function definition
- Even if we pass arguments that are a few more than 16 bytes (up to 24 bytes), we are still fine
- Howver, if we overflow the buffer, let's say by passing in `input="AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBCCCCCCCC"` and `length=16`, we leave the buffer context and start injecting into the broader stack context, which is more powerful than the buffer
- Unlike the buffer, the stack contains metadata about where the control flow of your program is supposed to return to when the function is done
- Thus, we no longer return to to original specified `0x555555555042` return address, but now return to a different `0x555550434343` address
- **Denial of Service (DDoS)**: This new address was not allocated so when the program tries to access it, it goes into a segmentation fault and the program crashes

### Problem: Overflow Attack

- But we don't have to crash the program, we can instead dictate where it is going to go next
- Let's say we have another `void win(void) { ... }` function that is inaccessible because it is at address `0x555555555021`, which is unreachable after the `foo` function is called and returns to `0x555555555042` instead of `0x555555555021`
- When we execute `foo("AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBB!", 25);` with 16 A's followed by 8 B's followed by an exclamation point, we leave the buffer context and go into the stack context, and in this stack context the function call overwrites/corrupts 1 byte of the end of the original return address from `42` to `21`
- The reason why it changes to `21` is that since our buffer size is 16, it starts to corrupt the return address after 24 bytes. Since our 25th byte is an `!`, and the ascii representation of `!` is the number `21`, it overwrites the end of the return address from `42` to `21`
